Mexico is a sovereign federal republic in North America. It borders the United States to the north, the Pacific Ocean to the south and west, and Belize, Guatemala and the Caribbean Sea to the southeast.

It is hoped that the difference in traffic between the two cities and the distance between the stations can be compared through Grasshopper, so as to set up a hotel in the most suitable location, which meets the needs of people who come for a short stay and need a small amount of time to arrive at the station and then leave. (Because most travelers or people who need to arrive at the station or airport early the next morning prefer to stay in hotels close to these stations)
