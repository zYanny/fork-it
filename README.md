## Introduction

Copenhagen is the capital, largest city and largest port of Denmark. It is located in the east of Sealand, Denmark, across the Øresund Strait from Malmö in Sweden.

Mexico City is the capital and political, economic, and cultural center of the United Mexican States. It is also one of the largest cities in the world. Mexico City is located in the middle of the plateau region in central Mexico

## Planning
It is hoped that the difference in traffic between the two cities and the distance between the stations can be compared through Grasshopper, so as to set up a hotel in the most suitable location, which meets the needs of people who come for a short stay and need a small amount of time to arrive at the station and then leave. (Because most travelers or people who need to arrive at the station or airport early the next morning prefer to stay in hotels close to these stations)

## Step

stage1
- 对两个城市的特定地点进行标注从而获得最初的基础点

stage2
- 使用grasshopper 进行分析
